# TodoList
A to-do list app using SwiftUI with a MVVM architecture pattern, also incorporated UserDefaults into the application to save and persist data between sessions.

MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel...
The Model contains logic for the data layer.
The View contains logic for the app's UI.
The ViewModel contains the business logic for the app, connecting the View to the data (Models)!
